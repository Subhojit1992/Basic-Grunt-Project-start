# Basic-Grunt-Project-Start
Build your any grunt project from scratch. Default use HTML5 Boilerplate, Bootstrap and also use Jquery for your any website project or start a web-app from scratch. You can customize anything as per your requirements.

## How to use this for your any project
First thing first. Download the file as a zip or clone it on your pc and open the command line tool. I will suggest to using Git-Bash, Power-Shell or Cmder for your command line tool.

Next make your you systems has installed followings:
- 1. Node with NPM
- 2. Git
- 3. Grunt
- 4. Sass
5. Compass (Optional)

Now open up your command line tool and navigate your project directory. And type
```JavaScript
npm install
```
You can see this will donload the all dependencies. After finish this you can see a folder called node_modules has been created on your project directory. Now run the task form Gruntfile.js

Now in your command line tool write
```JavaScript
grunt
```
you can now see every task will running accordingly and a build folder will be created in css, js and img.

You can customize any task to edit the Gruntfile.js ( for more information visit http://gruntjs.com/getting-started )

## Conclusion
This is very basic grunt boilerplate. You can use this to start your any grunt project. 

As you might imagine, there is a lot of leveling up you can do with your build process.
